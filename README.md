# Coffee-Calculator
This is a fail-proof pour over coffee recipe I have been using for years to maintain 
a consistent flow, agitation, and extraction to create some of my best cups of coffee.

To use this app, you will need a scale, a kettle, whole bean coffee, and a coffee grinder. 

**TIPS:**
A nice cup of coffee can be produced from about 15 grams of beans. For larger portions of
coffee brewed in the chemex, typically 50 grams is recommended. 
If your looking to extract a more punchy denser flavor from your grounds, I recommend the
ratio  to be closer to 1:16, whereas a more tea-like ratio to be around 1:17; however, you are
free to experiment! My frequent ratio is 1:16.4 as a safe spot to discover a good feel for the
coffee. The coffee:water ratio uses your initial coffee bean weight to calculate the final
amount of water used in the entire process.

**GRINDING:**
You will grind your coffee to the recommended setting on your grinder for Pour Over coffee.
Typically this will result in grounds that looks like coarse seasalt. If your coffee has a 
more bitter taste and denser body, I suggest grinding a tick coarser- likewise if your coffee
yields a more watered down flavor, grind a touch finer.

**USING THE APP:**
Adjust your coffee weight.
Set to your desired ratio.
Heat your water just a touch before boiling [mine is set to 95-96°C (203-205°F)]
Follow the prompts for the pours— you will be shown how much to add with each pour,
and your target weight you need to hit on the scale. It's perfectly okay to not hit the numbers
exact every time, that's what makes each cup special!
At the end of your Final Pour, you will see what is suggested to be a good drawdown for this
recipe. If the water flows completely through all of the grounds during the the prompts on the
screen, either make some adjustments or enjoy your brew!
